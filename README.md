#Luigi-GCloud

Congratulation - your wrote a bunch of Cloud DataFlows, Spark jobs or had your arsenal of Pig and Hive script migrated to the Google Cloud Platform. Now itâ€™s time to bring them in production. Have you thought about reliability, data availability, retries after failure?

Workflow management should not be an afterthought, it should be part of your development process. But don't start writing a lot of code, rely on a workflow manager. 

Luigi (<https://github.com/spotify/luigi>) is a workflow manager where you describe your workflow as a Directed Acyclic Graph. What makes Luigi unique is that it doesn't use some DSL or XML to describe it, but Python code. Write a class to describe the task at hand, and all it's dependencies. Luigi will do the rest in making sure your task will run.

## What is Luigi-GCloud

Luigi-gloud is an extension on luigi that gives a consistent integration to all of Google Cloud's Big Data services. Here is an example of 

```python
class DataProcSparkCopy(DataProcSparkTask):
    day = luigi.DateParameter()

    def output(self):
        return GCSFlagTarget(self.day.strftime('gs://bucket/out/%Y/%m/%d'))

    def job_file(self):
        return "/luigi-spark/build/libs/luigi-spark-copy-1.0.jar"

    def name(self):
        return "spark-copy-${year}-${month}-${day}"

    def main(self):
        return "luigi.gcloud.spark.Copy"

    def args(self):
        return [
            self.day.strftime('gs://bucket/in/%Y/%m/%d'),
            self.day.strftime('gs://bucket/out/%Y/%m/%d')
        ]

    def variables(self):
        return {
            # used in the name customisation
            'year': self.day.strftime('%Y'),
            'month': self.day.strftime('%m'),
            'day': self.day.strftime('%d'),
        }
```
